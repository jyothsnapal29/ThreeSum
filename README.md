# ThreeSum
Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.  Design an algorithm for the 3-SUM problem that takes time proportional to n2 in the worst case. You may assume that you can sort the n integers in time proportional to n2 or better.


For example, given array S = {-1 0 1 2 -1 -4},

    A solution set is:
    (-1, 0, 1)
    (-1, -1, 2)
